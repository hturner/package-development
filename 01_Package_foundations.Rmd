# Package Foundations

- Package vs script
- States of a package
- Setting up development tools
- Create a package with a working function

---

# Why write a package?

-  You want to **generalise** code
-  You want to **document** code
-  You want to **test** code
-  You want to **share** code
-  You want to create **impact** from your work

---

# Script vs Package

| R script                       | Package                             |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| One-off data analysis          | Provides reusable components        |
| Defined by `.R` extension      | Defined by presence of `DESCRIPTION` file |
| `library()` calls              | Imports defined in `NAMESPACE` file |
| Documentation in `#` comments  | Documentation in files and `Roxygen` comments |
| Run lines or source file       | Install and restart                 |


???
reusable components: typically functions, but could also be R markdown template, Shiny app, data

---

# Package structure

An R package is developed as a directory of source code files.

The names of files and directories must follow the specification laid out in 
the [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html) 
manual - we'll cover the main components in this workshop.

Directory tree for an example RStudio package project:

```{r, structure, echo = FALSE}
# usethis::create_package("mypackage", open = FALSE)
dir_tree("mypackage")
```
    
---

# Package States

.pull-left-narrow[
-  .tip[source]
-  bundled
-  binary
-  installed
-  in-memory
]

.pull-right-wide[
.tip[
What you create and work on.

Specific directory structure with some particular components e.g., `DESCRIPTION`, an `/R` directory.

]
]

---

## Package states

.pull-left-narrow[
-  source
-  .tip[bundled]
-  binary
-  installed
-  in-memory
]

.pull-right-wide[
.tip[
Package files compressed to single `.tar.gz` file.

Also known as "source tarballs".

Created by command line tool `R CMD build`

Unpacked it looks very like the source package.
]
]

???

In the rare case that you need to make a bundle from a package you’re developing locally, use devtools::build(). Under the hood, this calls pkgbuild::build() and, ultimately, R CMD build, which is described further in the Building package tarballs section of Writing R Extensions.

---

## Package states

.pull-left-narrow[
-  source
-  bundled
-  .tip[binary]
-  installed
-  in-memory
]

.pull-right-wide[
.tip[
Compressed copy of the package in installed form.

Also a single file.

Platform specific: `.tgz` (Mac) `.zip` (Windows).

Package developers submit a bundle to CRAN; CRAN makes and distributes binaries.
]
]

???

A package in binary form is Platform specific.
If you write a package for distribution on CRAN, you submit a bundle to CRAN then CRAN makes and distributes binaries


`install.packages()` is usually downloading the binary

To understand the difference between package bundle and a package binary see https://r-pkgs.org/package-structure-state.html

---

## Package states

.pull-left-narrow[
-  source
-  bundled
-  binary
-  .tip[installed]
-  in-memory
]

.pull-right-wide[
.tip[
A directory of files in a library directory.

Any C/C++/Fortran code is in compiled form.

Help files, code and optionally data are in database form.

`install.packages()` can install from source or from a binary

]
]

???

Add speaker notes

## Package states

.pull-left-narrow[
-  source
-  bundled
-  binary
-  installed
-  .tip[in-memory]
]

.pull-right-wide[
.tip[

If a package is installed, `library()` makes its function available by loading the package into memory and attaching it to the search path.

# Building/Installing Packages from Source

There are various reasons we may wish to build or install from source:

- Installing a CRAN package where a binary has not yet been built for the latest version.
- Installing a package from GitHub/other version-controlled source code repository, e.g.
    ```{r install_github, eval = FALSE}
    remotes::install_github("r-lib/revdepcheck")
    ```
- Installing our own package from the source code or building it to submit to CRAN.

If the package includes C/C++/Fortran code, we will need a suitable compiler.

# Build Tools

---

# Windows: Rtools

For Windows a bundle of utilities is maintained that contains all the system tools you need for installing R packages from source (and for building R from source).

 - Download the latest Rtools installer for your R version from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
 - Run the installer keeping the default settings.

???

May have done this last time for C++, but do again if updated R to 4.2 in the meantime as R Tools now updated

---

# Mac OS: Xcode

The Xcode command line tools will provide what you need to install R packages from source.

Use Finder to check if Xcode is already installed. Otherwise:

Option 1

 - [Register as an Apple developer (for free)](https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/)
 - In the terminal, run `xcode-select --install`
 
Option 2 (more convenient but installs a lot you don't need)

 - Install the current release of full [Xcode from the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

???

For all Linux distributions the recommended installation includes the tools to compile R packages.

# Package development setup

---

# Package development setup

We'll be using the following tools for package development:

- RStudio: to manage and edit the package source code
- git + GitHub: to version control the package source code
- `devtools` R package: for functions supporting the development workflow
    - Depends on `usethis` package: for setup tasks
    - Integrated with RStudio: projects, menu items/shortcuts
    - Uses system utilities internally: `R CMD` utilities bundled with R
    
---

## devtools

We can se `devtools` right away to check our system is setup for package development.


```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

```{r}
library(devtools)
```

```{r message = TRUE}
has_devel()
```

Installing `devtools` will also install `usethis`.

---

# Create a GitHub PAT

The `usethis` package uses personal access tokens to communicate with GitHub.

Running the following command opens a form to create a PAT:

```{r eval = FALSE}
usethis::create_github_token()
```

- Use the "Note" to record the computer and OS you're using, e.g. "Latitude5420-Windows"
- Generate a token with the standard settings
- Copy the PAT and keep the browser tab open until you have completed the next step

???

Can set host to private GitHub here too.
usethis::create_github_token(host = "https://github.warwick.ac.uk/")
gitcreds::gitcreds_set(url = "https://github.warwick.ac.uk/")
---

## Store your PAT

By installing `usethis`, you will also have the `gitcreds` package to manage git credentials.

Put your PAT into the Git credential store by running the following command and entering your copied PAT at the prompt.

```{r eval = FALSE}
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

???
Prompt should looks like this:
> gitcreds::gitcreds_set()


? Enter password or token:
If they already have a PAT set
-> Your current credentials for 'https://github.com':

  protocol: https
  host    : github.com
  username: PersonalAccessToken
  password: <-- hidden -->

-> What would you like to do? 

1: Keep these credentials
2: Replace these credentials
3: See the password / token

---

## Check Git configuration

Ask for a **sit**uation **rep**ort.

```{r eval = FALSE}
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

Check that the PAT is discovered.

Check that your user name and email are defined, else follow the [configuration instructions](https://hturner.github.io/advanced-r/01_open_code_and_software.html#17) from the Advanced R workshop.

## Create a package!

---

## Package name

Can only contain the characters [A-Z, a-z, 0-9, .]. Some tips:

-   Unique name you can easily Google
-   Avoid mixing upper and lower case
-   Use abbreviations
-   Add an r to make unique, e.g `stringr`
-   Use wordplay, e.g. `lubridate`
-   Avoid trademarked names
-   Use the `available` package to check name not taken

For now, we will use `mypackage`

---

## Create a package!

Be deliberate about where you create your package.

Do not nest inside another RStudio project, R package or git repo.

Verify that you can create a package with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
usethis::create_package("~/Desktop/mypackage")
```

You may want to use a different path!

---

## `create_package()`

What happens when we run `create_package()`?

-   R will create a folder called `mypackage` which is a package and an RStudio project
-   restart R in the new project
-   create some infrastructure for your package
-   start the RStudio Build pane

---

## R Studio Build pane/menu

.pull-left[
![A screenshot of the RStudio Build pane, with buttons "Install and Restart", "Check" and the dropdown "More" menu with items "Load All Ctrl+Shift+L", "Clean and Rebuild", "Test Package Ctrl+Shift+T", "Check Package Ctrl+Shift+E", "Build Source Package", "Build Binary Package", "Document" and "Configure Build Tools...".](rstudio_build_pane.png)
]
.pull-right[
![A screenshot of the RStudio Build menu. This has the same options as the "More..." menu in the Build pane, plus "Install and Restart" and "Stop Build" (non-selectable when no build activity is running).](rstudio_build_menu.png)
]


---

## Minimal components

`usethis` will create the minimal components of a package that we have already seen:

-   `DESCRIPTION` provides metadata about your package. 
-   `NAMESPACE` declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages.
-   The `/R` directory is where we will put `.R` files with function definitions.

---

## Auxiliary files

`usethis` also add some auxiliary files:

-   `mypackage.Rproj` is the file that makes this directory an RStudio Project.
-   `.Rbuildignore` lists files that we need but that should not be included when building the R package from source.
-   `.gitignore` anticipates Git usage and ignores some standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio.

---

# Use Git

???

Now will make our package a version controlled project on our local machine and then put it on GitHub.

devtools has function to help with this.

---

## Use Git

To make our project a Git repository, or 'repo' on our local machine we use `usethis::use_git()`

Make your package a Git repo

```{r eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
```

---

# `use_git()` Output Part 1

```{r eval = FALSE}
 ✔ Initialising Git repo
 ✔ Adding '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store' to  '.gitignore' 
 There are 5 uncommitted files:
 * '.gitignore'
 * '.Rbuildignore'
 * 'DESCRIPTION'
 * 'mypackage.Rproj'
 * 'NAMESPACE'
 Is it ok to commit them?

 1: I agree
 2: Absolutely not
 3: No way
```

Choose the affirmative option!

---

# `use_git()` Output Part 2

```{r eval = FALSE}
√ Adding files
√ Commit with message 'Initial commit'
• A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane
Restart now?

1: Nope
2: Definitely
3: No
```

Choose the affirmative option!

???
 You should find the git pane has opened.

---

## Use GitHub

To create a copy on GitHub we use `usethis::use_github()`.

This takes a local project, creates an associated repo on GitHub, adds it to your local repo as the "origin remote", and makes an initial "push" to synchronize.

You can use a private GitHub instance, e.g.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_github("https://github.warwick.ac.uk")
```

However, Warwick GitHub does not support GitHub Actions or GitHub Pages, so for packages is better to use a private repo on GitHub 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_github(private = TRUE)
```

---

## `use_github()` Output

```{r eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_github()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
 ✔ Creating GitHub repository 'hturner/mypackage'
 ✔ Setting remote 'origin' to  'https://github.com/hturner/mypackage.git'
 ✔ Setting URL field in DESCRIPTION to  'https://github.com/hturner/mypackage'
 ✔ Setting BugReports field in DESCRIPTION to  'https://github.com/hturner/mypackage/issues'
 There is 1 uncommitted file:
 * 'DESCRIPTION'
 Is it ok to commit it?

 1: Nope
 2: For sure
 3: No way
```

Select the affirmative option.

???

Take a look at the repo on GitHub. There is no `/R` folder as that folder is empty at the moment!

---

## Adding functions

Functions will go in an `.R` file in the `/R` directory.

There's a `usethis` helper for adding `.R` files!

```{r eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_r("file_name")
```

Use a separate `.R` file for each function or closely related set of functions.

???

e.g. a summary method and its print method; a top-level function and the internal functions it calls, etc

--

`usethis::use_r()` adds the file extension (you don't need to).

---

## `usethis::use_r()`

Create a new R file in your package called `animal_sounds.R`


```{r eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_r("animal_sounds")
```

The output includes:

```{r eval = FALSE}
• Modify 'R/animal_sounds.R'  
*• Call `use_test()` to create a matching test file 
```

Ignore the instruction to call `use_test()` for now - we'll cover testing later.

???
Ignore this line "Call `use_test()` to create a matching test file"  for today. A later module will cover testing.

---

## Add a function

Put the following toy function into your script:


```{r eval = FALSE}
animal_sounds <- function(animal, sound) {
    stopifnot(is.character(animal) & length(animal) == 1)
    stopifnot(is.character(sound) & length(sound) == 1)
    message("The ", animal, " goes ", sound, "!")
}
```

Don't try to use the function yet!

---

## Development workflow

In a normal script, you might use:

```{r eval = FALSE}
source("R/animal_sounds.R")
``` 

but for building packages, we will use the `devtools` approach.

This will ensure our function has the correct namespace and can find internal functions, functions imported by our package from other packages, etc.

---

## Development workflow

.center[
```{r, out.width = "600px", echo=FALSE, fig.alt = "schematic of the development workflow. there are three boxes with arrow joining them clockwise. The boxes are (clockwise from 3' oclock) 'devtools::load_all() Cmd/Ctrl + Shift +L', 'Explore in console' and 'Modify code'"}
knitr::include_graphics("dev_cycle_before_testing.png")
```
]

--
.center[
You don't even need to save your code!
]

???

devtools::load_all() simulates package installation so that you can test your function.

A shortcut is Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + L

---

# Your turn

1. Load all with `devtools::load_all()` and try calling the `animalSounds()` function with appropriate values for `animal` and `sound`.
2. Change some tiny thing about your function - maybe the animal “says” instead 
of “goes”?
3. Load all with `devtools::load_all()` and try calling the updated function to see the changed behaviour.
4. Add `animal_sounds.R` so that it is tracked by git. Make a commit with the message `Add animal_sounds()`.
5. Push all your commits from this session.
