# R-Universe

With [R-Universe](https://r-universe.dev/), you can create a personal, CRAN-like repository.

Binaries are built for Windows and MacOS, which a user can install using 
`install.packages()`, e.g.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Enable repository from lrioudurand
options(repos = c(
  lrioudurand = 'https://lrioudurand.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
# Download and install malt in R
install.packages('malt')
```

---

# Create your R Universe
 
1. Create a git repository named "universe" on your GitHub account.
2. Add a `packages.json` file listing the (public) git repos to include
    ```
    [
        {
            "package": "malt",
            "url": "https://github.com/lrioudurand/malt"
        }
    ]
    ```
3. Install the [R-universe GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/r-universe/installations/new) on your GitHub account.
4. Wait for your packages to start appearing on https://<githubusername>.r-universe.dev once they have finished building.

# CRAN

---

# Why publish on CRAN?

- Sign of quality
   - Code is ready to be used (not a beta version)
   - Basic standards: documented code, running examples, etc
   - Works with current version of R and other packages 
   - Commitment of maintainer
- Discoverability
- Ease of installation
- Bioconductor, rOpenSci: even higher standards, code review

---

## First submission to CRAN

Read the official [Checklist for CRAN Submissions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/submission_checklist.html) 
to check requirements beyond the automated checks.

Read the community-created [Prepare for CRAN](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/prepare-for-cran) checklist.

Useful functions for additional checks:
- `goodpractice::gp`
- `spelling::spell_check_package`

---

## Run "as CRAN" checks

[CRAN policies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) state that you must run `R CMD check --as-cran` _on the tarball to be uploaded_ with the current version of R-devel.

First make sure the package passes check locally:
```r
devtools::check()
```

Then send to CRAN's win-builder to check on R-devel
```r
devtools::check_win_devel()
```

Further options: R-Hub (multiple platforms available, with different compilers) and Mac-builder (with M1)
```r
devtools::check_rhub()
devtools::check_mac_release()
```

---

## Prepare submission

Write submission notes
```r
usethis::use_cran_comments()
```

Then submit to CRAN
```r
devtools::release()
```

This asks you questions which you should carefully read and answer.

`usethis::use_release_issue()` creates a GitHub issue with a checklist.

---

## cran-comments.md

```
 ## Test environments
 * local OS X install (R-release)
 * win-builder (R-release, R-devel) 

 ## R CMD check results

 0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

 * This is a new release.
```
There’s always one note for a new submission

---

## If your submission fails

Do not despair! It happens to everyone, even R-core members.

If it’s from the CRAN robot, just fix the problem & resubmit.

If it’s from a human, do not respond to the email and do not
argue. Instead update cran-comments.md & resubmit.

---

## For resubmission

```
 This is a resubmission. Compared to the last submission, I
 have:

 * First change.
 * Second change.
 * Third change.

 --

 ## Test environments
 * local OS X install, R 3.2.2
 * win-builder (devel and release)

 ## R CMD check results
 ...
```

---
 
## Subsequent submissions to CRAN

Proceed as before. If you have reverse dependencies you need to also run 
R CMD check on them, and  notify CRAN if you have deliberately broken them.

Fortunately the revdepcheck package makes this fairly easy

```r
install_github("r-lib/revdepcheck")
use_revdep_check()
library(revdepcheck)
revdep_check()
revdep_report_cran()
```

# Promotion

---

# Promoting your package

- Some promotion will/may be done for you: [CRANberries](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/), [R Views](https://rviews.rstudio.com/) Monthly Top 40, 
search engines (vignette/pkgdown site)
- Some channels are obvious: website, blog, Twitter (#RStats)
- Publicize your new package via R Weekly https://rweekly.org/
    - Add to the weekly news blog, see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md), and example pull requests [new package](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org/pull/279), [new version](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org/pull/277).
- Would your package fit in a CRAN Task View? https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/
    - Check [GitHub organization](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv) for how to propose addition

---

# Talks

- Meetups: Warwick RUG, Coventry R-Ladies
- Conferences (https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/events.html)
    - **General**: useR!, rstudio::conf, satRdays
    - **Specific**: R/Finance, BioC, Psychoco
    - **Non R-specific**: ???
- Conferences provide greater exposure, particular to people working in relevant
field(s).
- Don't forget to share your slides! (Conference/personal website, LinkedIn, 
RPubs, Slideshare)

???

In advance

# Paper

- A paper not only promotes your package but benefits from peer review
    - Paper can also overlap with vignette
- Traditional journals:
    - **Open Source Software**: The R Journal, Journal of Statistical Software
    - **Computing**: Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, Journal of 
    Computational and Graphical Statistics, SoftwareX
    - **Science**: Bioinformatics, PLOS ONE, Method in Ecology and Evolution
- Alternative journals:
    - F1000research Bioconductor/R package gateway: publish, then open review
    - [Journal Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/): open code review, short descriptive paper

# Maintenance

---

# Interacting with users

- Bug reports/help requests
    - Can show where documentation/tests need improving
    - Help you find out who's using your package and what for
    - Can give ideas for new features
    - Can lead to collaborations
- Avoid using email, so that other people can benefit
    - GitHub issues
    - Stackoverflow questions    
    
---

# Interacting with developers

* Add a code of conduct, e.g. Contributor Covenant
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    usethis::use_code_of_conduct()
    ```
* Add a CONTRIBUTING.md to your GitHub repository
    - Do you have a style guide?
    - Reminders to run check/tests/add NEWS item to pull requests
* Use tags to highlight issues: the following are promoted by GitHub
    - `help wanted`
    - `good first issue`
* Add topics to your GitHub repo so potential contributors can find it    
* Take advantage of events e.g. [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), [Closember](https://closember.org/)  

---

# Consider the longer-term

* Write developer documentation
 - `pkgdown` articles that are not vignettes: put in sub-directories of `/vignettes`
 - Articles only in the source: add to `.Rbuildignore`
* Buddy-up
 - Review each other's code
 - Co-author each other's packages
