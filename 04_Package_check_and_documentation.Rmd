## Check your package!

---

## R CMD check

`R CMD check` is the command line utility provided by R to check R packages.

It checks that all the components are valid and consistent with each other, in particular:
 - Metadata in DESCRIPTION
 - Imports and exports in NAMESPACE
 - `.Rd` files in `/man`
 
It will also run any examples and tests you have written.

`devtools::check()` will run `R CMD check` in the background, with the results shown in the Build pane.

???

Note that only tests will check the correctness of code


---
## Run `devtools::check()`

You will get lots of output. It will end with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
-- R CMD check results -------------------- mypackage 0.0.0.9000 ----
Duration: 32.8s

*> checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... WARNING
*  Non-standard license specification:
*    `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a
*    license
*  Standardizable: FALSE

0 errors √ | 1 warnings x | 0 notes √
```

We haven't yet specified a license for our package.

???

On running `check()` you may get an error if you are using a networked drive.
There's a fix coming in a few slides.

---

## Aside: in case of error

On running `devtools::check()` you may get an error of the form

```
Updating mypackage documentation  
Error: The specified file is not readable: path-to\mypackage\NAMESPACE  
```

This can happen if your repo is on a networked drive.

This is covered in this [Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40530968/overwriting-namespace-and-rd-with-roxygen2) and can be fixed.

---

## Aside: a fix for networked drives

Save a copy of this file:

[fix_for_networked_drives.R](fix_for_networked_drives.R)

Save it somewhere other than the `mypackage` directory

Open the file from the `mypackage` project session

Run the whole file

You should now find that `devtools::check()` proceeds normally


---

## Types of problem

**ERROR** Must fix to get the code/example/test working

**WARNING** Fix if sharing with others

**NOTE** Fix if submitting to CRAN

It is possible to submit to CRAN with a NOTE, but it’s best avoided

# DESCRIPTION

---

## Metadata in `DESCRIPTION`

- *Package*: The package name. The `changer` package can help you change the name!
-  *Title*: One line, title case, with no period. Fewer than 65 characters.
-  *Version*
    - for release: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version.
    - for development version building on version MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, use: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.9000
- *Authors@R*: A call to `person()` that is run to create the Author field when the package tarball is built. "aut" means author, "cre" means creator (maintainer), "ctb" means contributor.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    person("A", "Person", email = "a.person@email.com", 
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0001-2345-6789"))
    ```


???

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.


The are two types of documentation: package level and function level.
The DESCRIPTION file provides some of the package level documentation (or metadata)

---

## Metadata in `DESCRIPTION`

-  *Description*: One paragraph describing what the package does. Keep the width 
of the paragraph to 80 characters; indent subsequent lines with 4 spaces.
-  *License*: Will discuss later
-  *Encoding*: How to encode text, use UTF-8 encoding.
-  *LazyData*: If `true` data sets in the package are stored in a database during package installation and loaded from the database as required. 

???
Add speaker notes

lazy loading means that data is only loaded if needed.
This means that they won’t occupy any memory until you use them.
do NOT include LazyData: true in DESCRIPTION unless you actually ship data in your package.

# License

---

## There are three main open source licenses

1. CC0: “public domain”, best for data packages.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    usethis::use_cc0_license()
    ```
2. MIT: Free for anyone to do anything with (including bundling in closed source product).
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    usethis::use_mit_license()
    ```
3. GPL: Changes and bundles must also be GPL
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    usethis::use_gpl_license()
    ```
 - If you are including someone else's GPL code directly, you must use GPL.


???

https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/open-source-licensing.html

somewhat personal down to how important you consider open source to be and what you are happy with people doing with your code

Suggest academic: GPL; community/other: MIT

---

# Proprietary packages

You can use `usethis::use_proprietary()` to make it clear that your package isn’t open source.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_proprietary(copyright_holder = "ACME Ltd")
```

In DESCRIPTION:
```
License: file LICENSE
```
In LICENSE:
```
Copyright 2022 ACME Ltd. All rights reserved.
```

???

usethis::use_proprietary

---

## Your Turn

1. Open the DESCRIPTION file and add a title and description.
2. Add yourself as an author and creator.
3. Add an MIT license.
4. Run the package check.
5. Commit changes to GitHub.

Tip: You can use Ctrl/Command + . and start typing a file name to open a file for editing

# README

---

## README

The README is the quick start guide to your package.

It should include 
 - a brief overview
 - instructions on how to install the package
 - a few examples
 
You should be able to borrow from the DESCRIPTION and help files!

---

## Creating a README

** usethis** has functions to set up a README with/without R code

```r
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
usethis::use_readme_md()
```
`README.Rmd` must be rendered to make `README.md` each time it 
is changed.

`usethis::use_readme_rmd()` creates a _pre-commit hook_ to check if `README.Rmd` and `README.md` are out of sync before committing.

Use `build_readme()` to render with the latest version of the code.

???

`build_readme` creates a temporary version of the package

# Continuous Integration

---

# Running Automatic Checks

GitHub actions allow you to run code every time you push to GitHub.

 - `usethis::use_github_actions()` sets up a bare-minimum workflow that runs R CMD check with the latest release of R on Linux.
 - `usethis::use_github_action_check_standard()` sets up a GitHub action 
that runs R CMD check with the latest release of R on Linux, Mac, and Windows and with both the previous release and development release of R on Linux.

The practice of merging new code into the repository and running checks each time is known as Continuous Integration.

???

You can set up GA on Warwick but it doesn't do anything!

Use the second option for serious projects

---

# Your Turn

1. Create a README for `mypackage` with `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`.
2. Fill in the description and an example.
3. Try adding the README in a git commit - it should fail!. Render the 
README with `build_rmd()`, then add both `README.Rmd` and `README.md` in a git commit.
4. Run `usethis::use_github_action()`. It adds a badge to the README, so you will need to render the README again.
5. Commit all the changes to git.

---

## Vignettes

Vignettes are long-form documentation for your package.

They use R markdown to integrate code and output into the documentation.

Typically:
 - A single/main vignette showing a complete workflow. 
 - Optional further vignette(s) going deeper on one aspect/application
 - Optional further vignette(s) for specialist audience (methodologists or developers)

???

a vignette with the same name as the package (e.g., vignettes/pkgdown.Rmd or vignettes/articles/pkgdown.Rmd) automatically becomes a top-level "Get started" link, 

Fairly short read ~10 minutes

---

## Easiest way to get started is with `use_vignette()`

```r
usethis::use_vignette("name")
```

Adds to DESCRIPTION

<pre>
Suggests: knitr
VignetteBuilder: knitr
</pre>

Creates `vignettes/`

Drafts `vignettes/name.Rmd`

---

## Vignette = Rmarkdown + special metadata

```

---
title: "Vignette Title"
author: "Vignette author"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
vignette: >
%\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title}
%\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
%\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
---

```
* `html_vignette` output uses a custom style sheet to keep the file size of the 
HTML as small as possible.
* The `vignette:` field contains special metadata needed when the package is 
built. **Don't forget to change the title here too!**

---

# Vignette workflow

.center[
```{r, out.width = "750px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("vignette_workflow.png")
```
]

??? 

Need to install package so can call with `library()`

---

# Your turn

1. Install your **animal_sounds** package and restart R 
(Install & Restart button).
2. Create a simple vignette that shows how to use `animal_sounds()`.
3. Fix the "vignette title" in the YAML header.
4. Knit the vignette to preview it.
5. Run `devtools::install(build_vignettes = TRUE)` to install the package with the vignettes. Call `browseVignettes()` to open your vignette.
6. Commit your changes to git.

---

class: inverse middle

# NEWS

---

# Track changes in a NEWS file


```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_news_md()
```

Add news for the latest version at the top.

Use a top-level heading for each release version

```r
# mypackage 1.0.0
```

---

## What news to include

Add each change in a bulleted list
 - If you have many changes, split into subsections (e.g.
    `## Major changes`, `## Minor improvements`, `## Bug fixes`).
 - Wait until release to decide if subsections are necessary
 
Note connections to GitHub
 - If related to a GitHub issue, add the issue number, e.g. (`#10`). 
 - If related to a pull request, add the pull request number and the author, e.g. (`#101, @hadley`).

# Package website with pkgdown

---

## A website for your package with pkgdown

The **pkgdown** package is designed to make it quick and easy to build a website for your package

Why have a website for your package?
  - Google-ability
  - Examples with output!
  
Setup `pkgdown` infrastructure
```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_pkgdown()
```


---

## Build a website

`pkgdown::build_site()` creates a package website based on the 
standard documentation files.

**Home page**: based on README

**Reference**: 
 - one page for help file
 - generates an index page, with functions listed alphabetically by default

---

## Build a website (ctd)

**Articles**: one page for each vignette

**Get Started**: if you have a vignette with filename = package name

**News**: based on NEWS.md

Plus:
 - A link to your GitHub repo (if listed in the DESCRIPTION url field).
 - A link to the License
 - Any badges added to your README (e.g. from GitHub Actions)

---

# Your turn

1. Run `usethis::use_pkgdown()` - this will ask you to install `pkgdown` if you 
don't already have it.
2. Run `pkgdown::build_site()` to create a website for your package!

No need to commit to changes to git just yet!

---

## Hosting your website

- You can host your website directly from its GitHub repo
- The recommended approach is to let GitHub build your page, instead of committing and pushing the artifacts of the built website (i.e., html files) to GitHub
- `usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")` will add an action to your GitHub repo to be run automatically every time you push to it to rebuild the site
- See https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html#publishing for more on this

---

## Your Turn

1. Run `usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")` and commit and push all changes
2. Go to your repo on GitHub and click on the Actions tab
3. Once the action completes running, go to Settings > Pages (scroll down on the left) and change the Source to `gh-pages`
4. Click on the link provided on that page to see your pkgdown website
- Bonus: Add this link to the `DESCRIPTION` of your package in a new `URL` field
